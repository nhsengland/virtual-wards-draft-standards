 ## Overview & Purpose

This draft implementation guidance is being developed to improve interoperability for virtual wards, with the transfer of Supplementary Remote Monitoring Data from a Virtual Ward Stay to external clinical systems. 

Our intention is to work towards a draft standard and iterate these standards over time with our stakeholders, through weekly touchpoints and agile ways of working.
Our key stakeholder groups are:
- Remote Monitoring Suppliers
- ICS/ICBs
- NHS Healthcare Providers
- Destination System Suppliers

This standard should not be implemented instead of a current solution but built alongside and used to support any current integrations. 

The guidance should help guide and set standards for enabling the sharing of data for virtual wards.

**Please only develop against the standard if you are working with us directly.**
