 ## Overview

This draft implementation guidance is being developed to improve interoperability for virtual wards, with the data transfer of a Virtual Ward Care Record Summary at the end of the patient stay to external clinical systems.

Our intention is to work towards a mandated standard and iterate on this first draft. 

This standard isnâ€™t to be implemented instead of a current solution but built alongside and used to support any current integrations.

This space is being used as a collaborative tool to develop this implementation guidance - the stakeholders involved are:

- NHS England Virtual Wards Interoperability Team
- Remote Monitoring Suppliers
- ICS/ICBs
- NHS Healthcare Providers
- Destination System Suppliers

**Please only develop against the standard if you are working with us directly**

## Purpose

This implementation guidance should help guide and set standards for enabling the sharing of data for virtual wards.
