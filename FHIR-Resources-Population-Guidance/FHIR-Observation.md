# 3.4.2 FHIR UK Core Observation Resource

> *Content to be included in future version releases*

> *IMPORTANT - this page is intended as **guidance** only, solutions must be clinically assured locally within organisations before deployment into a live environment.*

## Usage
An Observation resource represents a single clinical observation or measurement made about a patient, such as a laboratory test result, a vital sign, or a diagnostic imaging study. The Observation resource is used to capture structured data about the observation, including the type of observation, the value or result, the time and location of the observation, and other relevant metadata. It supports a range of data types, such as numeric values, text, and codes, and allows for the inclusion of additional information, such as the device or method used to capture the observation and any relevant comments or interpretations.
