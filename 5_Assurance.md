# 5. Assurance

Implementations of this standard are to be owned and assured locally by the organisations sending and receiving the data. 

> *Note that all information on this page is intended as **guidance only**. NHS England is not responsible for assuring solutions.*

## 5.1 Clinical Safety



## 5.2 Information Governance

It is important to ensure that solutions comply with information governance regulations and best practices. For guidance on protecting data and handling information securely, please see the [NHS Website](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance). 

Organisations must ensure that they have the relavant Data Sharing Agreements and Data Sharing Impact Assessments (DPIAs) in place, in-line with local policy, before systems go live. 

## 5.3 Security

It is important that development of any data transfer mechanism incorporates security best-practice and assurance at each stage. 

We recommend that:
- Organisations ensure they are compliant with the [NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit](https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/) and [Cyber Essentials Plus](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview)
- Systems undergo regular penetration testing and IT Health Checks
- Systems have a written System Level Security Policy (SLSP)
- Appropriate authentication and authorisation is in place to protect access to shared data. These mechanisms must be tested and assured locally.
